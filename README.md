# COMP3015-c1Prototype: Low-Poly Forest
---
<p>This an OpenGl project that showcases custom shader using GLSL. The redered scene shows 3 animal and 3 tress on a plain, the models are low-poly meshes with a different texture for each of them. The final aim for this project, is to have a space ship abducting one of the animals as well as utilize multiple shaders to provide some visual variety. THe current shader that this scene is using is Blinn-Phong, it also has one spot light (**This will be replaced with an alien beam in the final showcase**). </p>
